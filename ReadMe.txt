There are some basic information about files in "DeepNeuralNetworkForAuthorNameDisambiguation"
This information is added for researcher who are starting there work and want to execute program. In one view you can see how can disambigute author name. It consist of 4 files.

PairwiseDNNForAuthorName.py (main program that is executable by using python programming language and some libraries like keras and tensorflow others can be seen in import section in program)

Resultforpairwiseauthornamedisambigation.py (It is a executed result file that is generated after execution of "PairwiseDNNForAuthorName.py". This is a visualization of result that was produced.)

DatasetForPairwiseAuthorAnderson.csv (This file contains a chunk of dataset that will use for input for "PairwiseDNNForAuthorName.py" in "url_1,url_2" you can give path of this data . these values are genrated by using pairewise citations data and Jaccard similarity measure is used)

12946109.xml (this is an example file of dataset. this is first look of dataset from which we extract features and further processing was done. it is added for researcher who are starting there work and want to execute program)
